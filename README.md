## Customization

### Adding New Bus Routes
Edit `src/data/mockData.js` to add new routes, buses, or operators:

```javascript
export const mockBuses = [
  {
    id: 'BUS006',
    number: 'KA-06-KL-1111',
    route: 'Bangalore to Kochi',
    operator: 'KSRTC',
    // ... other properties
  }
]
```

### Styling
The application uses CSS custom properties and utility classes. Main styles are in:
- `src/index.css` - Base styles and utilities
- `src/App.css` - Component-specific styles

### Adding Real API Integration
Replace mock data functions in `src/data/mockData.js` with actual API calls:

```javascript
export const getBusById = async (id) => {
  const response = await fetch(`/api/buses/${id}`)
  return response.json()
}
```
